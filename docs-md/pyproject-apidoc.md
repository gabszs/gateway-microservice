The file `pyproject.toml` is a configuration file used by Python projects to define project metadata, dependencies, build configurations, and other project-specific settings. It is particularly used by tools such as Poetry, which manage Python project dependencies and packaging. Below is a detailed explanation of the contents of the file:

### [tool.poetry]

- **name**: This specifies the name of the project. Here, it's `"gateway"`.
- **version**: This denotes the version of the project, `"0.1.7"`, following semantic versioning.
- **description**: A brief description of the project. It's currently empty.
- **authors**: A list of authors of the project. This includes the name and email of the author: `"GabrielCarvalho <gabrielcarvalho.workk@gmail.com>"`.
- **readme**: Specifies the README file, `"README.md"`, that usually contains detailed information about the project.

### [tool.poetry.dependencies]

This section lists the dependencies required for the project to run:

- **python**: Specifies the Python version compatibility, here between `3.11` and `3.13`.
- **pydantic-settings**: Version `^2.3.4`, used for settings management with Pydantic models.
- **python-jose**: Version `^3.3.0`, a library for handling JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **bcrypt**: Version `^4.1.3`, used for password hashing.
- **fastapi**: Version `^0.114.2`, a web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. The `extras = ["all"]` indicates additional optional dependencies.
- **aiohttp**: Version `^3.10.5`, an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework.
- **python-multipart**: Version `^0.0.9`, used for parsing multipart/form-data, commonly used with file uploads.
- **pika**: Version `^1.3.2`, a pure-Python RabbitMQ client library.
- **aiobotocore**: Version `^2.15.1`, an asynchronous version of the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3).

### [tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]

Lists the development dependencies, which are required only for developing the project, not for running it:

- **pytest-cov**: Version `^4.1.0`, a plugin for coverage reporting with pytest.
- **taskipy**: Version `^1.12.2`, a task runner that integrates with Poetry.
- **ruff**: Version `^0.1.8`, a fast Python linter.
- **pytest-asyncio**: Version `^0.23.2`, a Pytest plugin for asyncio support.
- **freezegun**: Version `^1.4.0`, a library for mocking datetime in Python.
- **faker**: Version `^24.1.0`, a library for generating fake data.
- **ipykernel**: Version `^6.29.3`, provides the IPython kernel for Jupyter.
- **pytest**: Version `^8.1.1`, a testing framework for Python.
- **icecream**: Version `^2.1.3`, a library for debugging and introspecting.
- **requests**: Version `^2.32.3`, a simple HTTP library for Python.

### [build-system]

- **requires**: Specifies the build-time dependencies, here it requires `poetry-core`.
- **build-backend**: Specifies the backend used to build the project, `poetry.core.masonry.api`.

### [tool.taskipy.tasks]

Defines custom tasks to be run using Taskipy:

- **run**: Runs the application using Uvicorn, a lightning-fast ASGI server, on port 5555 with hot-reloading enabled.
- **lint**: Runs the Ruff linter on the codebase.
- **pre_test**: A pre-test task that runs the linter.
- **test**: Runs the tests using pytest with additional options for verbosity and coverage.
- **verbose_test**: Similar to `test` but with more detailed output.
- **commit_hook**: Runs pre-commit hooks on all files.
- **post_verbose_test**: Generates an HTML report of the coverage after running verbose tests.
- **post_test**: Generates an HTML coverage report after running tests.

### [tool.ruff]

Configuration for the Ruff linter:

- **exclude**: Lists directories to be excluded from linting, typically those that should not be checked (e.g., version control directories, build artifacts).
- **line-length**: Sets the maximum line length to 120 characters.
- **indent-width**: Sets the indentation width to 4 spaces.
- **target-version**: Assumes Python 3.8 features are available.

### [tool.ruff.lint]

- **select**: Specifies which linting rules to enable, focusing on certain pycodestyle (`E`) and Pyflakes (`F`) codes.
- **ignore**: Lists linting rules to ignore (e.g., `E701`).
- **fixable**: Allows automatic fixing of all enabled rules.
- **unfixable**: No rules are marked as unfixable.
- **dummy-variable-rgx**: Allows ignoring of unused variables if they are underscore-prefixed.

### [tool.ruff.format]

- **quote-style**: Uses double quotes for strings, similar to Black.
- **indent-style**: Uses spaces for indentation.
- **skip-magic-trailing-comma**: Set to `false` to respect magic trailing commas.
- **line-ending**: Automatically detects the appropriate line ending.

This file serves as a comprehensive configuration for the project, defining everything from dependencies and build systems to development tools and linting configurations. It enables consistent management of the project's environment and facilitates easy setup and deployment.
