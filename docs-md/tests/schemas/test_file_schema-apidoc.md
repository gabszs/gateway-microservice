# Detailed Documentation for `test_file_schema.py`

This file contains unit tests for validating the functionality of data schemas used in a FastAPI application. These schemas are presumably defined using Pydantic, a library that provides data validation and settings management using Python type annotations. The tests are designed to ensure that the schemas behave as expected when handling valid and invalid data.

## Imports

- `pytest`: A testing framework for Python that makes it easy to write simple and scalable test cases. It is used here to handle assertions and exceptions during testing.
- `ValidationError`: An exception class from Pydantic, used to catch validation errors that occur when data does not conform to the defined schema.
- `FileMetadata`: A Pydantic model imported from `app.schemas.file_schema`, representing the metadata associated with a file.
- `QueueMessage`: Another Pydantic model imported from `app.schemas.file_schema`, representing a message that includes information about a file and its associated client.

## Functions

### `test_file_metadata_valid()`

- **Purpose**: This test checks that the `FileMetadata` schema can successfully validate and create an instance when provided with valid data.
- **Logic**:
  - A dictionary `data` is defined with valid `file_name` and `content_type`.
  - An instance of `FileMetadata` is created using the unpacked dictionary (`**data`).
  - Assertions verify that the `file_name` and `content_type` attributes of the instance match the expected values.

### `test_file_metadata_invalid_content_type()`

- **Purpose**: This test ensures that the `FileMetadata` schema raises a `ValidationError` when given an invalid `content_type`.
- **Logic**:
  - A dictionary `data` is defined with a valid `file_name` but an invalid `content_type` (`image/jpeg` instead of `video/mp4`).
  - A `pytest.raises` context manager is used to assert that a `ValidationError` is raised when attempting to create a `FileMetadata` instance with the invalid data.

### `test_queue_message_valid()`

- **Purpose**: This test verifies that the `QueueMessage` schema can successfully validate and create an instance when provided with valid data.
- **Logic**:
  - A dictionary `data` is defined with valid attributes, including `file_name`, `content_type`, `client_email`, and `download_link`.
  - An instance of `QueueMessage` is created using the unpacked dictionary (`**data`).
  - Assertions check that the `client_email` and `download_link` attributes of the instance match the expected values.

### `test_queue_message_invalid_email()`

- **Purpose**: This test ensures that the `QueueMessage` schema raises a `ValidationError` when given an invalid `client_email`.
- **Logic**:
  - A dictionary `data` is defined with a valid `file_name`, `content_type`, and `download_link`, but an invalid `client_email`.
  - A `pytest.raises` context manager is used to assert that a `ValidationError` is raised when attempting to create a `QueueMessage` instance with the invalid data.

## Key Logic

- **Pydantic Models**: The tests rely on Pydantic models (`FileMetadata` and `QueueMessage`) to enforce data validation. These models use Python type annotations to define the expected data structure and automatically perform validation.
- **Validation Handling**: The use of `pytest.raises(ValidationError)` is crucial in tests that expect invalid data to ensure that the application handles bad input gracefully by raising appropriate exceptions.
- **Assertions**: Simple assertions (`assert`) are used to verify that the model instances contain the correct data when created with valid input.

Overall, these tests are designed to maintain data integrity by ensuring that only valid data is processed by the application, thereby preventing potential errors or security vulnerabilities stemming from malformed input.
