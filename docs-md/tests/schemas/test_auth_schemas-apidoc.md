# File Documentation for `test_auth_schemas.py`

This file contains unit tests for validating the authentication schemas used in the application. The tests are designed using the `pytest` framework and involve the validation logic of Pydantic models defined in `auth_schema.py`.

## Import Statements

- `pytest`: A testing framework that allows you to write simple as well as scalable test cases.
- `ValidationError`: An exception class from Pydantic used to handle validation errors in data models.
- `SignIn`: A Pydantic model representing the sign-in request schema.
- `SignInResponse`: A Pydantic model representing the sign-in response schema.

## Test Functions

### 1. `test_sign_in_valid()`

This test verifies that a valid `SignIn` schema can be created without any errors.

- **Data**: A dictionary containing `email__eq` and `password`.
  - `email__eq`: A string representing the user's email.
  - `password`: A string representing the user's password.
- **Assertions**:
  - Confirms that the `email__eq` attribute of the `SignIn` instance matches the provided email.
  - Confirms that the `password` attribute of the `SignIn` instance matches the provided password.

### 2. `test_sign_in_invalid_email()`

This test checks that an invalid email format raises a `ValidationError`.

- **Data**: A dictionary with an invalid email format and a valid password.
- **Expected Outcome**: The test expects a `ValidationError` to be raised because the `email__eq` attribute does not conform to the email format expected by the `SignIn` schema.

### 3. `test_sign_in_missing_password()`

This test ensures that omitting the password field causes a `ValidationError`.

- **Data**: A dictionary with only the `email__eq` field.
- **Expected Outcome**: The test expects a `ValidationError` to be raised due to the missing `password` field, which is required by the `SignIn` schema.

### 4. `test_sign_in_response_valid()`

This test validates the correct creation of a `SignInResponse` schema with all necessary fields.

- **Data**: A dictionary containing `access_token` and `expiration`.
  - `access_token`: A string representing the authentication token.
  - `expiration`: A string in ISO 8601 format representing the token expiration date.
- **Assertions**:
  - Confirms that the `access_token` attribute of the `SignInResponse` instance matches the provided token.
  - Confirms that the `expiration` attribute of the `SignInResponse` instance matches the provided expiration date.

### 5. `test_sign_in_response_missing_token()`

This test checks that omitting the access token field in `SignInResponse` raises a `ValidationError`.

- **Data**: A dictionary with only the `expiration` field.
- **Expected Outcome**: The test expects a `ValidationError` to be raised due to the missing `access_token` field, which is required by the `SignInResponse` schema.

## Conclusion

This file demonstrates unit testing strategies for Pydantic models using `pytest`. It ensures that the authentication schema models handle valid data correctly and raise appropriate errors when invalid data is provided. These tests are essential for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the authentication feature in the application.
