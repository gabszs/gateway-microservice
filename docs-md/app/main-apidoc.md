# Documentation for `app/main.py`

This file serves as the entry point for a FastAPI-based microservice application. It initializes and configures the FastAPI app, sets up the necessary routes, and manages connections to a RabbitMQ server using a custom `rabbit_manager`. The application is designed to handle requests related to audio/video conversion services.

## Imports

- **`contextlib.asynccontextmanager`**: A decorator that enables the creation of asynchronous context managers using async functions. It is used here to manage the lifecycle of the FastAPI application.

- **`uvicorn`**: An ASGI server used to run FastAPI applications. It is responsible for starting the application and handling HTTP requests.

- **`FastAPI`**: The main class from the FastAPI library used to create the application instance.

- **`rabbit_manager`**: A custom module presumably responsible for managing RabbitMQ connections. It is imported from `app.helpers.rabbit_manager`.

- **`routers`**: A module containing the application's routes, imported from `app.routes.v1`.

## Functions and Key Logic

### `init_app()`

This function initializes the FastAPI application with the necessary configurations and middleware. It incorporates the following key components:

- **Lifespan Management**: The function defines an asynchronous context manager (`lifespan`) using the `@asynccontextmanager` decorator. This context manager is used to initialize and close the RabbitMQ connection when the application starts and stops, respectively.

  - **`rabbit_manager.init()`**: Initializes the RabbitMQ connection when the application starts.
  
  - **`yield`**: Suspends the context manager to allow the application to run.
  
  - **`rabbit_manager.close_connection()`**: Closes the RabbitMQ connection when the application stops.

- **FastAPI Application Instance**: The `FastAPI` instance is created with several configurations:

  - **`title`**: "CV-Api", indicating the name of the API.
  
  - **`description`**: A brief description of the application's purpose, which is to manage services dedicated to audio/video conversion.
  
  - **`contact`**: Provides contact information for the API, including the author’s name, LinkedIn profile, and email address.
  
  - **`summary`**: A summary highlighting the best practices used in building the API, such as Test-Driven Development (TDD), Clean Architecture, and data validation with Pydantic V2.
  
  - **`lifespan`**: Associates the previously defined lifespan context manager with the application, ensuring proper startup and shutdown behavior.

- **Route Inclusion**: The function includes the application's routes using `app.include_router(routers)`.

- **Return**: The initialized FastAPI app instance is returned.

### Application Initialization

- **`app = init_app()`**: Calls the `init_app` function to create and configure the FastAPI application.

### Main Execution

- **`if __name__ == "__main__":`**: Checks if the script is being run as the main module.

  - **`uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=5555)`**: Starts the FastAPI application using Uvicorn as the ASGI server, exposing it on all available network interfaces (`0.0.0.0`) and setting the port to `5555`.

## Usage

The application can be started by executing this script directly. Once running, it listens for HTTP requests on the specified host and port. The defined routes in `app.routes.v1` are available for handling requests related to audio/video conversion services.
