# `auth_routes.py` - FastAPI Authentication Routes

This module defines the authentication-related API endpoints for a FastAPI application. It utilizes FastAPI's routing capabilities to handle HTTP requests related to user authentication. The routes defined here are part of version 1 (`v1`) of the API and are specific to authentication tasks.

## Imports

- **FastAPI Imports**:
  - `APIRouter`: A class provided by FastAPI to create modular route handlers. It allows you to organize your API into multiple route files.

- **Application Imports**:
  - `AuthServiceDependency`: This is a dependency that is likely used to handle authentication logic. The actual implementation is expected to be defined elsewhere in the application under `app.core.dependencies`.
  - `SignIn`: A Pydantic schema representing the structure of a sign-in request. It defines the expected data format for user sign-in operations.
  - `SignInResponse`: A Pydantic schema representing the structure of a response to a sign-in request. It specifies the format of the response data when a sign-in operation is successful.

## Router Configuration

- **`router`**: An instance of `APIRouter` configured with the following parameters:
  - `prefix="/auth"`: All endpoints registered with this router will be prefixed with `/auth`. This helps in organizing routes under a common path.
  - `tags=["Auth"]`: Tags are used for documentation purposes to group related endpoints. Here, it signifies that all routes in this module pertain to authentication.

## Endpoint Definitions

### Sign-In Endpoint

```python
@router.post("/sign-in", response_model=SignInResponse)
async def sign_in(user_info: SignIn, service: AuthServiceDependency):
    return await service.sign_in(user_info)
```

- **Method**: `POST`
- **Path**: `/auth/sign-in`
- **Request Model**: `SignIn`
  - The function accepts a `SignIn` object, which is automatically validated by FastAPI using Pydantic. This object represents the user credentials or information needed to perform a sign-in operation.
  
- **Response Model**: `SignInResponse`
  - The response is expected to conform to the `SignInResponse` schema, ensuring that the output is structured and documented.

- **Parameters**:
  - `user_info`: An instance of the `SignIn` schema, representing the incoming request data for a sign-in operation.
  - `service`: An instance of `AuthServiceDependency`. This is injected by FastAPI's dependency injection system, providing access to the authentication service logic.

- **Functionality**:
  - The `sign_in` function is asynchronous, denoted by the `async` keyword. This allows it to handle I/O-bound operations, such as database queries or network requests, efficiently.
  - The function calls the `sign_in` method on the `service` object, passing in the `user_info`. The `service.sign_in` method is expected to handle the authentication logic, such as verifying credentials against a database or an external authentication provider.
  - The result of the `service.sign_in` operation is awaited, meaning the function will pause until a result is returned. The result is then returned to the client, following the structure defined by `SignInResponse`.

## Conclusion

This module is a crucial part of a FastAPI application that deals with user authentication. It defines a clean and organized way to handle sign-in requests using FastAPI's routing and dependency injection features. The use of Pydantic models ensures that both requests and responses adhere to a specified structure, improving the reliability and maintainability of the API.
