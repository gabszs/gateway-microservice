# `__init__.py` for API Version 1 Routes

This module initializes and configures API routes for version 1 of the application. It uses FastAPI's `APIRouter` to aggregate multiple route modules under a single router with a version prefix.

## Imports

- **`from fastapi import APIRouter`**: This import brings in the `APIRouter` class from FastAPI, which is a tool for organizing routes into modules and combining them in a structured way.
  
- **`from app.routes.v1.auth_routes import router as auth_router`**: This line imports the router instance from the `auth_routes` module located in the `v1` directory, renaming it to `auth_router` for use within this file. The `auth_routes` module presumably contains routes related to authentication.

- **`from app.routes.v1.converter_routes import router as converter_router`**: Similar to the above, this imports the router from `converter_routes` and renames it to `converter_router`. This module likely contains routes related to data conversion operations.

- **`from app.routes.v1.ping_route import router as ping_router`**: This imports the router from `ping_route`, renaming it to `ping_router`. The `ping_route` is typically used for health checks or to test the API's responsiveness.

## Main Components

### `routers` Variable

- **`routers = APIRouter(prefix="/v1")`**: This line creates a new `APIRouter` instance with a prefix of `/v1`. This means that all routes included under this router will be accessible under the `/v1` URL path, indicating they are part of version 1 of the API.

### `router_list` Variable

- **`router_list = [auth_router, converter_router, ping_router]`**: This variable is a list containing the imported routers. It serves as a collection of all the routes that need to be included under the `v1` version of the API. Each element in this list corresponds to a different logical grouping of routes.

### Loop for Including Routers

- **`for router in router_list:`**: This loop iterates over each router in the `router_list`.
  
- **`routers.include_router(router)`**: Within the loop, this line adds each router to the `routers` instance. The `include_router` method is used to add a router and all its associated routes to a parent router. This effectively nests the routes under the `/v1` prefix.

### `__all__` Declaration

- **`__all__ = ["routers"]`**: This specifies the public API of the module. When `from module import *` is used, only the names in the `__all__` list are imported. Here, it indicates that the `routers` variable is the primary export of this module, making it available to other parts of the application.

## Summary

This file serves as the entry point for version 1 routes in the application. It imports individual route modules, aggregates them under a single `APIRouter` instance with a versioned prefix, and exposes this aggregated router for use in the FastAPI application. This structure promotes modularity and versioning, making it easier to manage and scale API endpoints.
