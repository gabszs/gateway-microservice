# Detailed Documentation for `rabbit_manager.py`

This module provides a utility class `RabbitMQManager` to manage connections and interactions with a RabbitMQ server. It uses the `pika` library for establishing and managing these connections. The class facilitates connection initialization, closure, and channel management using Python's context management protocol.

## Imports

- `pika`: A pure-Python RabbitMQ/AMQP client library.
- `BlockingChannel`: A class from the `pika.adapters.blocking_connection` module, representing a channel for communication.
- `Optional`, `Iterator`: Typing modules for type hinting, where `Optional` indicates that a variable can be of a specified type or `None`, and `Iterator` specifies an iterable return type.
- `contextmanager`: A decorator from the `contextlib` module to simplify resource management using the `with` statement.
- `settings`: Imported from `app.core.settings`, presumably a module that contains configuration settings for the application.

## Class: `RabbitMQManager`

### Overview

`RabbitMQManager` is designed to manage a connection to a RabbitMQ server. It handles connection initiation, closure, and provides a context manager to work with RabbitMQ channels safely.

### Attributes

- `rabbit_credentials`: Stores the credentials for RabbitMQ access, initialized as `None`.
- `rabbit_connection`: Holds the RabbitMQ connection object, also initialized as `None`.

### Methods

#### `__init__(self) -> None`

- **Description**: Initializes an instance of `RabbitMQManager` with no active connection or credentials.
- **Parameters**: None
- **Returns**: None

#### `init(self, host: str = settings.RABBIT_URL, username: str = settings.RABBITMQ_USER, password: str = settings.RABBITMQ_PASS) -> None`

- **Description**: Establishes a connection to the RabbitMQ server if not already connected.
- **Parameters**:
  - `host`: The RabbitMQ server's URL (default from settings).
  - `username`: Username for authentication (default from settings).
  - `password`: Password for authentication (default from settings).
- **Returns**: None
- **Behavior**: 
  - Uses `pika.PlainCredentials` to create credentials.
  - Checks if a connection exists or is closed; if so, creates a new `BlockingConnection` with a 30-second heartbeat interval.
  - Prints a confirmation message upon successful connection.

#### `close_connection(self) -> None`

- **Description**: Closes the current RabbitMQ connection if it is open.
- **Parameters**: None
- **Returns**: None
- **Behavior**: 
  - Checks if an active connection exists and is open.
  - Closes the connection and sets the connection attribute to `None`.
  - Prints confirmation of the closure.

#### `get_rabbitmq_channel(self) -> Iterator[BlockingChannel]`

- **Description**: A context manager that yields a RabbitMQ channel, ensuring that the connection is open.
- **Parameters**: None
- **Returns**: An iterator yielding a `BlockingChannel`.
- **Behavior**:
  - Checks if the connection is active. If not, attempts to reopen it using `init()`.
  - Yields a channel from the connection.
  - Ensures the channel is closed after use, regardless of success or failure.

#### Note on `publish_message`

The file contains a commented-out method `publish_message`. This method seems intended to publish a message to a RabbitMQ exchange with error handling. However, it is incomplete and commented out. It would involve:

- Publishing a message to a specified exchange and routing key.
- Handling exceptions, potentially removing associated files and raising an error.

## Global Instance

- `rabbit_manager`: An instance of `RabbitMQManager` created at the module level for use throughout the application.

## Function: `get_rabbit_channel() -> Iterator[BlockingChannel]`

- **Description**: A utility function that provides a RabbitMQ channel using the `RabbitMQManager` instance's context manager.
- **Parameters**: None
- **Returns**: An iterator yielding a `BlockingChannel`.
- **Behavior**:
  - Utilizes the `get_rabbitmq_channel` method of the `rabbit_manager` instance.
  - Yields a channel within the context manager's scope.

This module is designed to facilitate robust interaction with RabbitMQ by abstracting connection management and providing utility functions for channel operations.
