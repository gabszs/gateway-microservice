Below is a detailed documentation for the `dependencies.py` file located at `C:\Users\g50034179\Documents\fastapi\microservices_mpe\gateway\app\core`. This file is part of a FastAPI application and contains dependency functions and annotations that are used throughout the application to manage user authentication, service instantiation, and integration with external resources.

### Overview

This module is responsible for defining dependency functions that can be injected into FastAPI route handlers. These dependencies include user authentication, access to external services, and resource management. The module leverages FastAPI's dependency injection system to provide these functionalities in a modular and reusable manner.

### Imports

- `Annotated`: Used to provide type annotations with additional metadata.
- `ClientSession`: Part of `aiohttp`, used for asynchronous HTTP requests.
- `Depends`: A FastAPI utility to declare dependencies.
- `BlockingChannel`: From `pika`, used for RabbitMQ communication.
- Custom imports (`app.core.exceptions`, `app.core.http_client`, etc.) are application-specific modules that provide additional functionalities like exceptions, HTTP client management, security, settings, helper utilities, and schemas.

### Dependencies

#### `async_s3`

An instance of `AsyncS3Manager` used to interact with AWS S3 services asynchronously. It is initialized at the module level and is used within the `ConverterService`.

### Functions

#### `get_current_user`

```python
async def get_current_user(user_credentials: UserSchema = Depends(JWTBearer())) -> UserSchema:
    return user_credentials
```

- **Purpose**: Retrieves the current user based on JWT authentication.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `user_credentials`: Automatically provided by the `JWTBearer` dependency, which validates and extracts user information from a JWT token.
- **Returns**: A `UserSchema` object representing the authenticated user.

#### `get_current_active_user`

```python
async def get_current_active_user(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)) -> User:
    if not current_user.is_active:
        raise AuthError("Inactive user")
    return current_user
```

- **Purpose**: Ensures the current user is active.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `current_user`: Injected from the `get_current_user` dependency.
- **Returns**: A `User` object if the user is active.
- **Raises**: `AuthError` if the user is inactive.

#### `get_auth_service`

```python
async def get_auth_service(client: ClientSession = Depends(get_async_client)) -> AuthService:
    return AuthService(client=client)
```

- **Purpose**: Provides an `AuthService` instance for handling authentication-related operations.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `client`: A `ClientSession` object obtained from the `get_async_client` dependency.
- **Returns**: An instance of `AuthService`.

#### `get_save_service`

```python
async def get_save_service(channel: BlockingChannel = Depends(get_rabbit_channel)) -> ConverterService:
    return ConverterService(async_s3, bucket_name=settings.upload_bucket_name, rabbit_channel=channel)
```

- **Purpose**: Provides a `ConverterService` instance for handling data conversion and persistence.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `channel`: A `BlockingChannel` for RabbitMQ communication, provided by the `get_rabbit_channel` dependency.
- **Returns**: An instance of `ConverterService`.

### Annotations

These are type annotations with dependency injection provided by FastAPI, used to simplify the injection of commonly used services or user information into route handlers.

- `AuthServiceDependency`: Annotates an `AuthService` instance using `Depends(get_auth_service)`.
- `CurrentUser`: Annotates a `User` representing the current authenticated user using `Depends(get_current_user)`.
- `CurrentActiveUser`: Annotates a `User` representing the current active user using `Depends(get_current_active_user)`.
- `SaveBucket`: Annotates a `ConverterService` using `Depends(get_save_service)`.

### Usage

These dependencies are typically used in FastAPI route handlers to inject necessary components like authenticated user details or service instances. This promotes code reusability and separation of concerns by decoupling the resource management logic from the business logic in route handlers.

### Conclusion

The `dependencies.py` file is a crucial part of the FastAPI application that facilitates dependency injection for user authentication, service instantiation, and external resource management, thus contributing to cleaner and more maintainable code structure.
