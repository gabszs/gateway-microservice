# enums.py

This module defines enumerations used within the application, specifically for user roles. Enumerations are a set of symbolic names bound to unique, constant values. In this file, the `enum` module from Python's standard library is used to define user roles in a clear and structured manner.

## Imports

```python
from enum import Enum
```

- **enum**: This is an import from Python's standard library. It provides support for creating enumerations, which are a way to organize a collection of related constants. In this file, it is used to define a set of constants representing user roles.

## Classes

### UserRoles

```python
class UserRoles(str, Enum):
    ADMIN = "ADMIN"
    MODERATOR = "MODERATOR"
    BASE_USER = "BASE_USER"
    GUEST = "GUEST"
```

#### Description

The `UserRoles` class is an enumeration that inherits from both `str` and `Enum`. This allows the enumeration members to be both strings and enums, enabling string comparison and storage while maintaining the benefits of enumeration. It represents different roles a user can have in the system.

#### Members

- **ADMIN**: Represents an administrative user role. Typically, users with this role have the highest level of access and can manage other users and system settings.

- **MODERATOR**: Represents a moderator user role. Users with this role usually have permissions to oversee and manage user interactions and content within the application, maintaining community standards.

- **BASE_USER**: Represents a regular user role. This is a standard account type that provides access to basic features without administrative or moderation privileges.

- **GUEST**: Represents a guest user role. This is typically the most restricted role, often allowing only limited access to the system's features, primarily for viewing or trial purposes.

#### Usage

The `UserRoles` enumeration can be used throughout the application to enforce role-based access control, ensuring that only users with appropriate roles can access certain features or perform specific actions. By using an enumeration, the code becomes more readable and maintainable, as it avoids the use of hard-coded role strings scattered throughout the codebase.

### Key Points

- Enumerations like `UserRoles` help prevent errors by providing a defined set of allowed values, which aids in maintaining consistency across the application.
- The use of `str` as a base class allows the enumeration members to be treated as strings, which can be useful for serialization and comparison operations.
- This design pattern is particularly beneficial in applications with role-based access control, as it provides a clear and concise way to handle different user permissions.
