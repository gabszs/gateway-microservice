Below is a detailed documentation for the provided `auth_schema.py` file located at `C:\Users\g50034179\Documents\fastapi\microservices_mpe\gateway\app\schemas\`.

## File Overview

The file `auth_schema.py` defines Pydantic models used in a FastAPI application for managing authentication-related data. Pydantic models are used for data validation and serialization, and are particularly useful in FastAPI for defining request and response bodies.

## Import Statements

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from pydantic import EmailStr
```

- `BaseModel`: This is a base class provided by the Pydantic library. It is used to define data models that include validation and serialization logic. By inheriting from `BaseModel`, the classes automatically gain these capabilities.

- `EmailStr`: This is a type decorator from Pydantic that validates that a given string is a valid email address. It's used to ensure that any email input conforms to standard email formats.

## Classes

### 1. `SignIn`

```python
class SignIn(BaseModel):
    email__eq: EmailStr
    password: str
```

- **Purpose**: This class represents the schema for a sign-in request. It is used to validate the data sent to the server when a user attempts to sign in.

- **Attributes**:
  - `email__eq`: An `EmailStr` type that ensures the provided email is in a valid format. The unusual naming with `__eq` suggests a potential use case for a filter or specific query parameter, although in a typical context, a simpler name like `email` might be more appropriate unless there's a specific need.
  - `password`: A `str` type representing the user's password. It is expected to be a plaintext password that will be validated against stored credentials.

### 2. `SignInResponse`

```python
class SignInResponse(BaseModel):
    access_token: str
    expiration: str
```

- **Purpose**: This class defines the schema for the response returned to the client after a successful sign-in operation.

- **Attributes**:
  - `access_token`: A `str` that represents the token issued to the client as proof of successful authentication. This token is typically used for subsequent requests to authenticate the user.
  - `expiration`: A `str` that indicates the expiration time or date of the `access_token`. This is important for the client to know when they will need to refresh the token or re-authenticate.

## Usage Context

These schemas are typically used in FastAPI endpoints to define the expected structure of incoming requests and outgoing responses. For example, `SignIn` would be used in a POST endpoint where a user provides their email and password to log in. The server would validate this input using the schema, ensuring the email is valid and the password is a string.

In response, after validating the credentials and generating an access token, the server would return a `SignInResponse` to the client. This response would include the access token and its expiration, allowing the client to use the token for authenticated API requests until it expires.

Overall, these schemas help maintain data integrity and security by ensuring that only valid data is processed and transmitted in the authentication workflow.
