# File Documentation: base_schema.py

This file defines several Pydantic models used in a FastAPI application. Pydantic is a data validation and settings management library for Python, leveraging Python type hints. The models here are used for data validation and serialization in a microservices architecture. Additionally, it includes a custom metaclass to make all fields of a model optional.

## Imports

- `datetime`: Provides the `datetime` object which is used to represent date and time.
- `Optional`: A special type hint from the `typing` module that indicates a variable can be of a specified type or `None`.
- `UUID`: A type from the `uuid` module used to represent universally unique identifiers.
- `BaseModel`: The base class from Pydantic for creating data models.
- `ModelMetaclass`: A metaclass from Pydantic used for internal model construction.

## Classes

### `Message`

```python
class Message(BaseModel):
    detail: str
```

- **Purpose**: This model represents a simple message structure with a single field.
- **Attributes**:
  - `detail` (str): A string field intended to hold a message or a detail string.

### `NoContent`

```python
class NoContent(BaseModel):
    pass
```

- **Purpose**: This model serves as a placeholder to represent an empty response or a model with no content. It inherits from `BaseModel` without adding any fields.

### `AllOptional`

```python
class AllOptional(ModelMetaclass):
    def __new__(self, name, bases, namespaces, **kwargs):
        annotations = namespaces.get("__annotations__", {})
        for base in bases:
            annotations.update(base.__annotations__)
        for field in annotations:
            if not field.startswith("__"):
                annotations[field] = Optional[annotations[field]]
        namespaces["__annotations__"] = annotations
        return super().__new__(self, name, bases, namespaces, **kwargs)
```

- **Purpose**: A custom metaclass that converts all fields of a model to be optional. This is useful when you want to create models where all fields are not required by default.
- **Key Logic**:
  - Iterates over all fields in the model's annotations and wraps them with `Optional`, unless they are private (fields starting with `__`).
  - Updates the `__annotations__` dictionary with these optional fields before creating the class.

### `ModelBaseInfo`

```python
class ModelBaseInfo(BaseModel):
    id: UUID
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime
```

- **Purpose**: A base model for entities that have standard metadata fields like an identifier and timestamps.
- **Attributes**:
  - `id` (UUID): A universally unique identifier for the model instance.
  - `created_at` (datetime): The timestamp when the model instance was created.
  - `updated_at` (datetime): The timestamp when the model instance was last updated.

### `FindDateRange`

```python
class FindDateRange(BaseModel):
    created_at__lt: str
    created_at__lte: str
    created_at__gt: str
    created_at__gte: str
```

- **Purpose**: A model for filtering records based on creation date ranges. Useful for querying databases with date constraints.
- **Attributes**:
  - `created_at__lt` (str): A string representing a date, used for filtering records created before this date.
  - `created_at__lte` (str): A string representing a date, used for filtering records created on or before this date.
  - `created_at__gt` (str): A string representing a date, used for filtering records created after this date.
  - `created_at__gte` (str): A string representing a date, used for filtering records created on or after this date.

### `Blank`

```python
class Blank(BaseModel):
    pass
```

- **Purpose**: Similar to `NoContent`, this model represents a blank or empty model. It might be used as a placeholder or base class for other models.
