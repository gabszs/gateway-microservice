# File Documentation: `__init__.py`

## Overview
This `__init__.py` file serves as the initialization script for the `services` package in a Python project. It is part of a microservices architecture using FastAPI, as indicated by its path. The main purpose of this file is to facilitate the import of key service classes from this package.

## Contents

### Imports
- **AuthService**: This class is imported from the `auth_service` module within the same package. It likely handles authentication-related operations, such as validating user credentials, issuing tokens, or managing sessions.

- **ConverterService**: This class is imported from the `converter_service` module within the same package. It likely provides functionalities related to data conversion, which could involve transforming data formats, units, or other types of conversions depending on the application's requirements.

### `__all__`
- **`__all__`**: This is a special variable in Python that defines the public interface of a module. By specifying `__all__ = ["AuthService", "ConverterService"]`, this file explicitly declares that `AuthService` and `ConverterService` are the only public symbols that should be accessible when this package is imported. This is useful for encapsulation, as it controls what is exposed to users of the package.

## Usage
When this package is imported elsewhere in the project, the `AuthService` and `ConverterService` classes can be accessed directly. This can be done using the following import statement:

```python
from gateway.app.services import AuthService, ConverterService
```

This allows other modules in the project to utilize the functionality provided by these services without needing to know their specific implementation details or the internal structure of the `services` package.

## Key Logic
The key logic of this `__init__.py` file is to streamline the import process for the `services` package by making the most important classes readily available. It acts as a central point of access to the core services provided by the package, thereby supporting a clean and organized codebase.
