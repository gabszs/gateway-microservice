# File: `auth_service.py`

## Overview

This file defines the `AuthService` class, which provides an interface to interact with an external authentication service. It primarily focuses on handling user sign-in operations by making HTTP requests to a specified authentication endpoint. The file leverages asynchronous programming using `aiohttp` to ensure non-blocking I/O operations.

## Imports

- **`ClientSession`**: Imported from the `aiohttp` library, it is used to create and manage HTTP client sessions for making asynchronous requests.
- **`ClientConnectionError`**: An exception from `aiohttp` that is raised when there is a connection error during an HTTP request.

Custom modules are also imported:
- **`AuthError` and `BadRequestError`**: Custom exception classes defined in the `app.core.exceptions` module. These are used to handle specific error scenarios related to authentication and bad requests.
- **`settings`**: Imported from `app.core.settings`, this provides configuration settings, including the URL for the authentication service.
- **`SignIn`**: A Pydantic schema imported from `app.schemas.auth_schema`, representing the data structure required for the sign-in operation.

## Class: `AuthService`

### Purpose

The `AuthService` class is designed to manage authentication-related operations by interfacing with an external authentication service. It encapsulates logic for sending sign-in requests and handling responses and errors.

### Constructor: `__init__`

```python
def __init__(self, client: ClientSession):
    self.client = client
```

#### Parameters

- **`client`**: An instance of `aiohttp.ClientSession`. This session is used to make HTTP requests to the authentication service.

#### Description

The constructor initializes the `AuthService` instance with a provided `ClientSession`. This session is used for managing and reusing connections efficiently across multiple requests.

### Method: `sign_in`

```python
async def sign_in(self, schema: SignIn):
    url = settings.AUTH_SERVICE_URL
    try:
        async with self.client.post(f"{url}/sign-in", json=schema.model_dump()) as response:
            data = await response.json()
            if response.status != 200:
                raise AuthError(detail=data["detail"])
            return data
    except ClientConnectionError as _:
        raise BadRequestError(detail="Auth Service not available")
```

#### Parameters

- **`schema`**: An instance of the `SignIn` schema, which contains the necessary data for a sign-in request. This typically includes user credentials such as username and password.

#### Description

This asynchronous method attempts to sign in a user by sending a POST request to the authentication service's `/sign-in` endpoint.

1. **URL Construction**: The URL for the authentication service is retrieved from the `settings.AUTH_SERVICE_URL` configuration.

2. **HTTP Request**: A POST request is made to the constructed URL with the sign-in data serialized as JSON using `schema.model_dump()`.

3. **Response Handling**:
   - The response is awaited and parsed as JSON.
   - If the response status is not `200 OK`, an `AuthError` is raised with details from the response.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If a `ClientConnectionError` is encountered (indicating the authentication service is unreachable), a `BadRequestError` is raised with a descriptive message.

5. **Return Value**: If successful, the method returns the parsed JSON data from the response, which typically includes authentication tokens or user information.
