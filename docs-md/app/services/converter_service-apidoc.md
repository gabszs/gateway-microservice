# File: converter_service.py

## Overview
This module provides a `ConverterService` class that handles video file operations such as uploading to an S3 bucket, downloading, removing, and publishing messages to a RabbitMQ queue. It is part of a microservices architecture using FastAPI.

## Imports
- `os`: Provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality like reading or writing to the file system.
- `pika`: A Python library for interacting with RabbitMQ, a messaging broker.
- `fastapi.UploadFile`: A class for handling file uploads in FastAPI applications.
- `fastapi.responses.StreamingResponse`: Used to stream file responses back to the client.
- `pika.adapters.blocking_connection.BlockingChannel`: A channel object for interacting with RabbitMQ synchronously.
- `pydantic.EmailStr`: A type for validating email addresses using Pydantic.
- `app.core.exceptions.BadRequestError`: A custom exception class for handling bad requests.
- `app.core.settings`: Contains application settings, likely including configurations for RabbitMQ.
- `app.helpers.AsyncS3Manager`: A helper class for managing S3 operations asynchronously.
- `app.schemas.file_schema.QueueMessage`: A Pydantic schema for message format to be used in the queue.

## Class: ConverterService

### Purpose
The `ConverterService` class provides methods to handle video file operations including uploading to S3, downloading from S3, removing from S3, and publishing messages to RabbitMQ.

### Constructor: `__init__`
- **Parameters:**
  - `async_s3`: An instance of `AsyncS3Manager` for handling asynchronous S3 operations.
  - `bucket_name`: The name of the S3 bucket where files will be stored.
  - `rabbit_channel`: A `BlockingChannel` for interacting with the RabbitMQ server.
- **Purpose:** Initializes the service with S3 manager, S3 bucket name, and RabbitMQ channel.

### Method: `upload_video_file`
- **Parameters:**
  - `file`: An `UploadFile` object representing the video file to be uploaded.
  - `client_email`: An `EmailStr` object representing the client's email.
- **Purpose:** Uploads the video file to the specified S3 bucket and publishes a message to RabbitMQ.
- **Logic:**
  1. Creates a `QueueMessage` instance containing file details.
  2. Reads the file content asynchronously.
  3. Uploads the file to S3 using the `put_object` method.
  4. Publishes a message to RabbitMQ with the file details.

### Method: `download_video_file`
- **Parameters:**
  - `object_name`: The name of the object (file) to be downloaded from the S3 bucket.
- **Returns:** A `StreamingResponse` object that streams the file content back to the client.
- **Purpose:** Downloads a video file from S3 and returns it as a streaming response.
- **Logic:**
  1. Fetches the object from S3 using the `get_object` method.
  2. Extracts content and content-type from the response.
  3. Returns the content as a `StreamingResponse` with the appropriate media type.

### Method: `remove_video_file`
- **Parameters:**
  - `object_name`: The name of the object (file) to be removed from the S3 bucket.
- **Purpose:** Removes a video file from the S3 bucket.
- **Logic:** Calls the `delete_object` method to remove the specified object from S3.

### Method: `publish_message`
- **Parameters:**
  - `object_name`: The name of the object (file) related to the message.
  - `queue_message`: A `QueueMessage` instance containing the message details to be published.
- **Purpose:** Publishes a message to RabbitMQ regarding the uploaded file.
- **Logic:**
  1. Attempts to publish the message to the RabbitMQ using `basic_publish`.
  2. If an exception occurs, it removes the uploaded file from S3 and raises a `BadRequestError`.

## Key Considerations
- The service uses asynchronous operations for S3 interactions, making it efficient for handling large files.
- Error handling is implemented to ensure that failed operations (e.g., message publishing) do not leave unused files in S3.
- The `QueueMessage` schema ensures that the messages sent to RabbitMQ are correctly formatted.
